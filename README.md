# 2024-2025 Real-time Hard Drive Anomaly Detection

Optional project of the [Streaming Data Analytics](https://emanueledellavalle.org/teaching/streaming-data-analytics-2024-25/) course provided by [Politecnico di Milano](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=837284&__pj0=0&__pj1=36cd41e96fcd065c47b49d18e46e3110).

Student: **[To be assigned]**

## **Background**  
Real-time data analysis is crucial for detecting anomalies in financial systems, industrial processes, and IoT networks. This project focuses on processing streaming data to efficiently identify unusual patterns.  

## **Goals and Objectives**  
- Implement an anomaly detection system for streaming data.  
- Compare different methodologies for real-time anomaly detection.  
- Evaluate system performance using real or synthetic datasets.  

## **Datasets**  
The data is provided by the **DEBS Grand Challenge 2024** (details available [here](https://2024.debs.org/call-for-grand-challenge-solutions/)).  

## **Methodologies/Models to Apply** (at least one)  
- **Threshold- and statistics-based methods** using **Esper, Spark Structured Streaming** (or an equivalent Stream Processor).  
- **Streaming Machine Learning** with **River, MOA, or CapyMOA** to detect anomalies adaptively.  

## **Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Precision/Recall** for anomaly detection accuracy.  
- **Latency** under varying workload conditions.  
- **Throughput** of event processing.  

## **Deliverable**  
A report detailing the adopted approach, implemented code, and system performance evaluation.
